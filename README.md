## Start with a single color to quickly and easily build a harmonious color palette.

This plugin was designed to make choosing colors a more accurate and efficient affair by using a base color to generate accurate monochromatic shades and it's relative color harmonies.

**To Use:**
- Run the plugin
- Select an element with a fill or background
- Click on 'Update' to refresh the color palette

**Notes:**
- While an element is selected you can keep clicking on 'Refresh' to generate new random color palettes.
- Click on the plus button next to a palette label to add the swatches to the document.
- If no element is selected, or if an element with no valid fill or background is selected(such as a group), the color palette defaults to grey.
- You can click on a swatch in the plugin's UI to update your currently selected element's fill or background (single elements only  - groups are not supported).
