## This plugin was designed to make picking colors a more accurate and efficient affair by using a single base color to generate a tints/shades/complementary swatch palette, which you can then use to update a selected element on the fly.

### To Use:
- Run the plugin from Figma
- Select an element containing a fill, background, or stroke
- Click on 'Update' to update the plugin's base color
- Click on a plugin swatch to update a selected element with a pre-existing fill, background, or stroke.

### Notes:
- You can keep clicking on 'Update' to generate random color palettes based on your previous selection.
- Click on the plus button next to the palette label to add the swatches to your document.
- This plugin will work on any element that contains a solid fill, stroke, or background (groups not supported at the moment).
- All swatches in the plugin are able to update selected elements.
- Blend two colours by updating the palette with two elements with different fills.
